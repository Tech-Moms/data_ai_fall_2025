# Module 9: Create a Data Analyst Portfolio 

## Overview

This module teaches students how to build a professional, job-ready data analyst portfolio that showcases all the projects completed throughout the program, including work from Excel, SQL, Looker Studio, Tableau, Domo, and their capstone project. Students will learn how to select and refine their strongest work, write compelling case studies, structure their projects in GitHub, and fork & edit an existing portfolio on GitHub or a custom HTML/CSS/JavaScript site generated with AI. The module also prepares students to meet the Weber State Tech-Moms Data Analytics Microcredential requirements by ensuring their portfolios include multiple polished projects with written insights and evidence of Excel, SQL, and BI competencies. By the end of this module, each student will have a functional, public-facing portfolio that be added to a resume and shared with future employers. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

* Understand the purpose of a data analyst portfolio and how hiring managers review them.

* Publish a portfolio using Portfulim or GitHub Pages.
