# Module 9: Create a Data Analyst Portfolio 

## Overview

This module guides students through building a professional, job-ready data analyst portfolio that showcases all the projects completed throughout the program, including work from Excel, SQL, Looker Studio, Tableau, Domo, and their capstone project. The module also prepares students to meet the Weber State Tech-Moms Data Analytics Microcredential requirements by ensuring their portfolios include multiple polished projects with written insights and evidence of Excel, SQL, and BI competencies. By the end of this module, each student will have a functional, public-facing portfolio that can added to LinkedIn, their resume, and shared with future employers. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will:

* Understand the purpose of a data analyst portfolio and how hiring managers review them.
* Publish your portfolio using Portfolium and/or GitHub/GitHub Pages. 
* Update your LinkedIn to add your Weber State University Microcredential 
* Update your LinkedIn to add your capstone project 
* Update your resume to include a link to your portfolio and/or GitHub

## Why a Data Portfolio Is Important

A data portfolio is the most effective way to demonstrate your skills to potential employers. While résumés list tools and responsibilities, a portfolio shows real evidence of analytical thinking, problem-solving, and your ability to work with messy, real-world data. Hiring managers consistently rely on portfolios to assess whether a candidate can interpret data, communicate insights clearly, and build meaningful visualizations. A strong portfolio highlights your technical competence across tools like Excel, SQL, Looker Studio, Tableau, and Domo, while also illustrating your ability to tell a cohesive story with data. Most importantly, it helps you stand out in a competitive job market by providing tangible proof of your work, your process, and your growth as an analyst.
